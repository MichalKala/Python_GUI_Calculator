# Python_GUI_Calculator

First real application - calculator

It is not finished yet, looks pretty bad, but it works :) I started with simple operations, divide, multiply, plus and minus.

I actually thought this will be piece of cake but figuring out the buttons became little bit challenging.

I will continue to improve this app in next days.

UPDATE 5.6.2020 - three new buttons added - Squared, Square root and Powered
